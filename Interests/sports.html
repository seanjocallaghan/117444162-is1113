     <p><strong>Favourite Player:</strong>
     <br/>
     Tennis these days is in a very special era. Two of the greatest players to ever play the game are both present 
     in the game today, they are of course Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. These are my two idols.
     Their unrivaled athletic ability combined with their sportsmanship and respectfulness seperates them from all others
     and is why I admire them so much.

     <p><strong>Favourite Tournament:</strong>
     Wimbeldon is my favourite tournament in the tennis calender. The lush green lawns coupled with the historic tradition make it 
     unrivaled as the pristine prize in world tennis. Two years ago I was fortunate enough to go there myself and it fully lived up to 
     what I expected it would be. I got to see the top players in the world playing at the highest level.
